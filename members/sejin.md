### 개발 환경

- Windows : 아주 익숙함(리눅스, 미지의 세계)

- 언어 : C언어 조금 알고, 요즘은 Python

- Atom 에디터에서 프로그래밍

Note:
I am very familiar with Windows OS, but Linux is still unknown world.
I know a little bit about c language, and nowadays I mainly use Python.
C language is  really difficult language and Python is easier than C language. But both are difficult to me.
In my lab, 14 people are there, but the lab is not a big space, so it’s not good environment to concentrate on research.
But good place to be helped. It's a perfect lab for students who are not familiar with computer like me.
In my desk, there are dual monitors. the monitor on the left shows a photo that has a sad story hidden.
Last year, I took 광조 김‘s introductionory cryptography class.
광조 김 suggested that if any student who goes to the top of 지리산 mountain,
that student will earn extra point when evaluating grades.
So I and two younger army officers went to 지리산 mountain during the final exam period.
And then, I was sick for a week because of hard climbing.
