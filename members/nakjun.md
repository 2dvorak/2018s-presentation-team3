Note :
Let's start my presentation.
As you can see, my father is very handsome.
So...i think, that's why i'm handsome :)

Anyway, I took this picture when I was in middle school.
There is no difference from now.
Because i look so young.
But unfortunately, my height is also no different.
I'm very sad...

Note :
I'm Professor Kim's C&IS lab student.
So I am interested in PQC and block chains.

But frankly, the performance of this program was not good.

If you like table tennis, then please tell me.
And let's enjoy together.

### 개발 환경
 - C, C++ 선호 (Visual Studio)
 - OS : Window & Linux(Ubuntu)
![NJ_friend](images/NJ_friend.png)

Note :
Primarily, I prefer c or c++.
Because I do not know other programming languages.
So I'm going to study about Python later.

And I love Windows, but I'm not familiar with Linux.
So I think I need more time to get closer to linux.
I will do my best.

### 개발 환경
 - 단점 : 연구실내 묵언수행, 편한 의자 = Deep Sleep
![my_seat](images/my_seat.png)

Note :
This is my seat in the lab.
There is nothing special, but there are some disadvantages.
First, my left is Edwin from Gana, the back is Amananto from Indonesia, and the right is a window, so I can not say anything in the lab.
Second, the chair is too comfortable.
I think everyone knows what this means.
Deep sleep!

### 개발 환경
 - 장점 : N1 건물 9층. 환상적인 View 제공
![Lab_view](images/Lab_view.jpg)

Note :
But Look at this.
This place provides a fantastic view.
there is one advantage.
So I like this place.

Okay, my presentation is over.
Next, Sejin jeong will continue this presentation.
Thank you
